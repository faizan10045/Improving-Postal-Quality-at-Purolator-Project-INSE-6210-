# Improving-Postal-Quality-at-Purolator-Project-INSE-6210-

Purolator is a leading integrated freight, package and logistics solutions provider, they have built one of Canada’s most extensive transportation and logistics networks and supporting infrastructure. The advantages of this size and scale benefit for their customers, with more facilities in more regional centers than any other freight and parcel solutions provider in Canada. Nationally, provincially and regionally, their customers can count on best-in-class service and support from Purolator, wherever they are.

This project concentrates to provide an overview of the current technological developments in the postal market and assess to the recent developments of digitalization etc. In Montreal, Postal services face problems such as poor authorization during delivery, less options with International services, product limitations for the shipping, customer service-based problems etc. We will be using a DMAIC approach to solve these issues and come up with a structured strategy in implementing the analyzed proposition.
Major problems with Purolator post. Labor relation problems
Shipment Delays Efficiency Problems Innovational failures

Objectives:
1. Measure the influence of the problem faced by Purolator and find the real time solutions.
2. Analyze the cause of the problem with the help of the various techniques like root cause and cause and effect analysis
3. Improve the process by applying the lessons learnt by analysis phase.
4. Control and Observe the process.
5. Find Critical to quality parameters and perform pareto analysis.

Conclusion

The application of DMAIC methodology has shown positive results by identifying the key issues and solving them using total quality methodologies.
The study from the Purolator postal service showed that even though the process is out of control for more than 50 percentage, it can be brought to control by the implementation of six sigma through various techniques at various levels.
DPMO, Process capability were all improved and brought into control by using 5’s technique in the improved phase.
Some of the wastages removed by implementing 5’s technique in the improved phase is as follows

Transportation – not handling the packages properly. Waiting – time delays or idle time
Over-processing – unnecessary processing steps
Not using human resources – not implementing the ideas / suggestions of employees
Motion – actions of people that do not add value
The workers have a lack of Confidence.
